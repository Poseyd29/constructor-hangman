Constructor-Hangman

This application is simply hangman using node command lines.

If you have bash or terminal you can run the program there!

You will need to use the command npm install to install all the packages required.

Save the each code file into the proper directory in your computer to do so.

Whatever you decide to name your file/directory simply type in "node (directory-name).js*" to run the program. 

Try to guess the name of a sports team that I am thinking of.

Enjoy!
